# ForestFlow Release Methodology

## Release Cadence
ForestFlow does not have time-based cadence for releases. We will release patch releases to address critical bugs as
 necessary and combine new features and fixes into minor and major releases as milestones are met.

## Release Versioning
ForestFlow follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-200)

## Release Infrastructure
 - A release tag will be made available for manual builds.
 - We are in the process of identifying if (Docker/OCI-Compliant) container images will be made available 
 with every release as well.
