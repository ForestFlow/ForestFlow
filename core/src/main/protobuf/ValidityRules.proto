/**
  * Validity rules are used to define when a model is deemed in "Ready-to-Serve" state
  * Note that a model only starts its phase-in strategy after it has been deemed valid.
  * Validity rules are predominantly used to keep models running in Shadow Mode or to activate once a certain performance
  * threshold is meet. Models can also be updated from NeverValid to ImmediatelyValid manually.
  *
  * We may want to support an API with RBAC (role-based access control) that only allows for models to run in shadow mode
  * and as a result automatically sets the model's validity rule to NeverValid
